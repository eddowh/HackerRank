# Problem Statement

<https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/merge-two-sorted-linked-lists?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen>

# Solution

## Space Complexity

`O(1)`: besides the cursors, no new lists are created. This also means that the merge is _in place_.

## Time Complexity

`O(n)`: could be optimized by perhaps having another cursor.
